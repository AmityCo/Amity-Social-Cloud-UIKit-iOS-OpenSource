/// Since we support replacing compose bar with different styles.
/// At least all compose bar should conform to this protocol, and provide the following functions.
///
/// - Note: If your compose bar doesn't support some functionalities, just implement the function by returning the default value/ or do nothing.
///
/// Currently `EKoComposeBar`, is extracted from the existing implementation, that assume all functionalities works with `EkoMessageListViewController`.
///
/// For future improvement...
/// To properly make compose bar easily replaceable, the `EkoComposeBar` protocol and the flow  of `EkoMessageListViewController` need be refactored.
