## Overview Architecture
**MVVM** is cleanly separates presentation layer from the other layers. Divorcing one from the other improves its maintainability and testability. It also makes the application evolution easier in the future, thereby reducing the risk of technological obsolescence. 

Eliminates the need for application redesign user interfaces become outdated, or even add more complexity in the specific layer.
For example, adding local data source to the application could be impacts to the other layers.

Please note that every view model in this project will be named as **screen view model**, e.g. `AmityFeedScreenViewModel` and `AmityRecentChatScreenViewModel`.
